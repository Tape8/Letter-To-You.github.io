		<h1>hi my love,</h1>
<p>
i don't know where to start with this, but i thought it would be nice to surprise you with something different. i just thought making this website for you might brighten your day. i love you so much, and i hope you enjoy it x 
<div> 
you are the most incredible person i have ever met in my life. you are the first person in my life who has truly made me feel this special. you make me feel safe, loved, and so happy. you are the most generous, amazing, funniest, caring, loving, and sweetest girl ever. from the moment i met you, i knew that you were going to be someone special within my life. i don't know how i knew that, but i just had a feeling inside of me that told me you were going to have a big impact on my life. i have never been impacted by someone in the ways that you have impacted me. you have truly brought out a version of myself that i never knew existed. you make me so incredibly happy baby. i cannot even begin to express that enough. you've made me realise my self worth, as well as teaching and showing me the love that i truly deserve to experience. 
  <p>
you will never be able to understand just how grateful i am for you. everything you you do for me doesn't go unnoticed. i cannot even begin to tell you just how perfect you really  are. everything about you blows my mind. i have never met someone who is as jaw dropping as you are. i truly cannot even begin to understand how i am able to have someone like you. i'm in such awe of you. my brain genuienly cannot comprehend how someone can be just so perfect.

i never want you to forget how proud i am of you. i want you to remember how far you've come and how strong of a person you are. you should be so proud of yourself for your band compettitions, marching band, cheer, and giving it your absolute best when you were running for rodeo queen. i know that life can be challenging at times, but i want you to know that you are capable of overcoming any obstacle that comes your way. you never have to go through anything alone anymore. i'm always going to be by your side through anything that life may throw at you. you're so incredible and just know that as long as i'm here, you'll never be alone x 
  <p>
you have shown me a love that is so pure and unconditional, a love that shows no boundaries. you have such an incredible ability to make me feel like i'm the only thing that will ever matter to you. in your presence, i am surrounded by such a deep feeling of gratitude and compassion, and time seems to stand still whenever i'm with you. your unwavering support and belief in me has given me the courage to be able to chase and follow the paths that i want to within my life, and i'll never be able to thank you enough for being that push i needed. just your presence alone has the power to light up even the darkest of days, and your silly laugh never fails to bring a smile to my face. in your arms, i find such comfort and peace knowing that i am cherished, loved, and accepted for who i am. with you by my side, i feel an overwhelming sense of safety and love that i cherish beyond words.
